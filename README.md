# diffusion_evolution

Python notebook implementation of Diffusion Evolution from "Diffusion Models are
Evolutionary Algorithms" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02543).

This is a toy implementation of the basic algorithm, not the latent version.

Notebook can be found [here](diffusion_evolution.ipynb).
